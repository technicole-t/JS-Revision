# object-access problems

## object-access-1

`object-access-1.js` involves you creating variables holding accessing information that is inside objects and console logging this variable.

For each variable, delete the comments around each variable and replace the `...` with your code.

To see the `console.log`s, you will need to run the file with `node`; if you are in the `objects` folder itself, you can simply write `node object-access-1.js`. If you are not in the `objects` folder you will have to specify the right path to the file.

You do not need to write tests for these.
