# Fundamentals Revision

## Overview

The repo is broken down into 2 sections: array-methods and collections

### Array Methods

Within the array-method folder itself are three sub-sections:

- counting-problems
- filter-problems
- map-problems

All of the problems within the `array-methods` section should be done with thorough TDD (there are files for this within the `/spec` folder).

### Collections

This folder contains challenges involving interacting with objects and arrays.

Within the array-method folder itself are three sub-sections:

- arrays
- objects
- mixture

While some of the object-access ones don't require TDD, the rest should be done with testing.
